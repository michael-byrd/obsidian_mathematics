**Proposition:** Let $R$ be a nontrivial ring with identity.  
* $I = R$ if and only if $I$ contains a unit.
* Assume $R$ is commutative. $R$ is a field if and only its only ideals are $0$ and $R$. 

**Corollary:** Let $F$ be a field, then any nonzero ring homomorphism from $F$ to another ring is injective. 

**Maximal Ideal** - Let $R$ be a nontrivial ring with identity. An ideal $M$ is maximal if $M$ is a proper ideal and the only ideals containing $M$ are $M$ and $R.$ 

**Proposition:** In a ring with identity, every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. 

**Proposition:** Assume that $R$ is a commutative ring. An ideal $M$ is maximal if and only if $R/M$ is a field.

**Proposition:** Assume that $R$ is a commutative ring. An ideal $P$ is prime if and only if $R/P$ is an integral domain.

**Corollary:** Let $R$ be a commutative ring, then maximal ideals are prime ideals.

**Principial Ideal Domain** - A *principal ideal domain* is an integral domain where every ideal is principal. 

**Norm** - Let $R$ be an integral domain. A *norm* is function $N:R \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ where $N(0) = 0.$ If $N(a) > 0$ for all $a \neq 0,$ then $N$ is a *positive norm.*

**Euclidean Domain** - An integral domain $R$ is a *Euclidean domain* if there exists a norm $N$ on $R$ such that all pairs of elements $a,b \in R$ with $b\neq 0,$ there exists $q,r \in R$ such that $a = qb + r$ with $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(b).$  

**Proposition** - Euclidean domains are principal ideal domains.
