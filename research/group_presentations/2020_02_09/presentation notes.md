* Introduce the idea of approximating two curves
* Discuss the idea of an excursion
* Demonstrate how an intersection can be loss due to an excursion and how the same approx. can be produced with non-intersection curves
*  gain of a tangential intersection
* multiple crossings turn into 1 intersection
