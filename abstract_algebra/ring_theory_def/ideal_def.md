**Ideal** - Let $R$ be a [[ring_def|ring]], $I \subseteq R,$ and $r \in R.$
1. Define $rI = \{ra : a\in I\}$ and $Ir = \{ar : a \in I\}.$
2. $I$ is a *left ideal* if
	1. $I$ is a closed [[subring_def|subring]] of $R$
	2. For all $r \in R, rI \subseteq I.$
		1. We say I is a *right ideal* if $Ir \subseteq I.$
3. A set this is both a left and right ideal is called a (two-sided) ideal.
