**Ring** - A *ring* is a set $R$ with two binary operations called $+$ *addition* and $\times$ *multiplication* such that 
1. $(R, +)$ is an abelian group.
2. $\times$ is associative, that is, $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c), \forall a,b,c \in R.$
3. Multiplcation distributes over addition, that is, $(a+b) \times c = a \times c + b \times c$ and $a \times(b + c ) = a \times b + a \times c, \forall a,b,c \in R.$
