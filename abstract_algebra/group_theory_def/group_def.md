**Group** - Let $G$ be a set with a binary operation. We say that $G$ is a group if the following properties are satisfied: ^884e0c
1. $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all $a,b,c \in G.$ ^0a06a7
2. There is an element $e \in G$ such that $ae=ea=a, \forall \ a \in G.$
3. For all $a \in G,$ there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $ab = ba = e.$
