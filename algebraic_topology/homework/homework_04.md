1. Show that the composition of paths satisfies the following cancellation property: If $f_0 \cdot g_0 \simeq f_1 \cdot g_1$ and $g_0 \simeq g_1$ then $f_0 \simeq f_1.$ 
2. Show that for a space $X$, the following three conditions are equivalent:
	1. Every map $S^1 \rightarrow X$ is homotopic to a constant map, with image a point.
	2. Every map $S^1 \rightarrow X$ extends to a map $D^2 \rightarrow X.$
	3. $\pi_1(X, x_0) = 0$ for all $x_0 \in X.$
3. Find the explcit reparemetrization that shows for paths $\gamma_1, \gamma_2,$ and $\gamma_3$ with $\gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(0)$ and $\gamma_2(1) = \gamma_3(0),$ $\left[ (\gamma_1\cdot \gamma_2) \cdot  \gamma_3 \right] = \left[\gamma_1 \cdot (\gamma_2 \cdot \gamma_3)\right].$
4. Find the explicit homotopy that shows that for loops $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ where $\gamma_2(t) = \gamma_1(1-t), \gamma_1 \cdot \gamma_2$ is homotopic to a constant loop.
