# Definition
![[ideal_def]]
![[quotient_ring_def]]
**Proposition**: A quotient ring is indeed a ring. 
**Proposition**: If $I \subseteq R$ such that $$\begin{align*} (a+I)+(b+I) &= (a+b)+I, \\ (a+I)\times(b+I) &= ab+I, \end{align*}$$ is well defined, then $I$ is an ideal of $R.$

## Special Ideals
* ![[proper_ideal_def]]
* ![[trivial_ideal_def]]
* The *sum* of $I$ and $J$ is $I+J = \{a+b:a\in I, b\in J\},$ and it is an ideal of $R.$
* The *product* of $I$ and $J$ is $IJ = \{ab:a \in I, b\in J\}.$ The product of two ideals is an ideal of $R.$
* The $n^{th}$ *power* of $I$ is $I^n,$ which consists of finite sums of the form $a_1,\ldots,a_n,$ with $a_i \in I.$ This is also an ideal of $R.$
* The intersection $I \cap J$ is an ideal of $R$ and $IJ \subseteq I \cap J.$
* Let $\left\langle S \right\rangle$ be the smallest ideal of $R$ containing $S,$ it is the *ideal generated by* $S.$
* An ideal $I$ is a *principal ideal* if $I = \left\langle s \right\rangle.$ **make a def**
* An ideal generated by a finite set is called a *finitely generated ideal.* **make a def**

## Properties
**Proposition:** Let $R$ be a nontrivial ring with identity.  
* $I = R$ if and only if $I$ contains a unit.
* Assume $R$ is commutative. $R$ is a field if and only its only ideals are $0$ and $R$. 

**Corollary:** Let $F$ be a field, then any nonzero ring homomorphism from $F$ to another ring is injective. 

## More Special Ideals
![[maximal_ideal_def]]

**Proposition:** In a ring with identity, every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. 

**Proposition:** Assume that $R$ is a commutative ring. An ideal $M$ is maximal if and only if $R/M$ is a field.

![[prime_ideal_def]]

**Corollary:** Let $R$ be a commutative ring, then maximal ideals are prime ideals.
