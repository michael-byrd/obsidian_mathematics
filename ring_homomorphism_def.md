**Ring Homomorphism** - Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. A *ring homomorphism* is a map $\phi: R \rightarrow S$ such that 
1. $\phi$ is a group homomorphism on the additive structure. That is, $\phi(a +_R b) = \phi(a) +_S \phi(b).$
2. $\phi$ preserves multiplication. That is, $\phi(a \times_R b) = \phi(a) \times_S \phi(b).$
