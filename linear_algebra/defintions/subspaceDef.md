**Subspace** - Let $V$ be a vector space, and let $W$ be a subset of $V.$ We define $W$ to be a *subspace* if $W$ satisfies the following conditons:
* If $v,w$ are elements of $W,$ their sum $v+w$ is also an element of $W.$
* If $v$ is an element of $W$ and $c$ a number, then $cv$ is an element of $W.$
* The element $\vze$ of $V$ is also an element of $W.$
