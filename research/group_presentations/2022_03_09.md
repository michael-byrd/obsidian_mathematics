# Brainstorm

* Recap
* Review idea of excursions
* Introduce C1, the lemma, and draw a sketch of the proof
* Loss of intersection example
* Code generated example of LOI
* Mistake of implementing C1'
* Correct way of implementing C1'
* Introduce new pair of curves that still has a intersection problem with the current use of C1'
* Proposed new solution using C1'

# TODO

* Can we produce a triple intersection graph?
* Output image of LOI from last time, but fxed with C1'
* Review the logic we used in the code from last weekly meeting (date)
* Create empty array in tikz
	* Create slides, one with 1 array and another with 2
*
