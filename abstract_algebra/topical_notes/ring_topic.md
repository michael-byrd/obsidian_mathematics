# Definition
![[ring_def]]
## Special Properties
* If multiplication is commutative, we say that $R$ is a *commutative ring.*
* I there exists a $1 \in R$ such that $1 \times a = a \times 1 = a, \forall a \in R,$ then $R$ is a *ring with identity.*
## Special Rings
* ![[division_ring_def]]
* A commutative division ring is a *[[field_def|field.]]* 
## Propositions
**Proposition**: Let $R$  be a ring.
1. For all $a \in R, 0a = a0 = 0.$
2. For all $a,b \in R, (-a)b = a(-b) = -(ab).$
3. For all $a,b \in R, (-a)(-b) = ab.$
4. Let $1 \in R,$ then $1$ is unique.
5. Let $1 \in R,$ then $-a = (-1)a.$

### Examples
* $(\mathbb{Z}, +, \times), (\mathbb{Q}, +, \times),(\mathbb{R}, +, \times),$ and $(\mathbb{C}, +, \times)$ under standard addition and multiplication are all commutative rings with identity.
* The set of matrices under standard matrix addition and multiplication is a noncommutative ring with identity.   
* $(2\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)$ under standard addition and multiplication is a commutative ring without identity. 
* $(\mathbb{Q}, +, \times),(\mathbb{R}, +, \times),$ and $(\mathbb{C}, +, \times)$ are all fields.
* The ring of real quaternions is a division ring that is not a field.
